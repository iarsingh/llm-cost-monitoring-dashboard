# llm-cost-monitoring-dashboard — interview questions and answers

[README](README.md) · [Project architecture](PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md)

Answers below use this repository’s files and implementation. They distinguish existing behavior from suggested extensions; source links let you verify each walkthrough.

## 1. What problem does llm-cost-monitoring-dashboard address, and what can you demonstrate?

Sum cost by service from posted lines and flag a budget miss.

I would demonstrate the linked implementation or examples and distinguish that evidence from any planned production features. Start with [`README.md`](README.md).

## 2. How is this repository organized?

- [`src/llmcost/main.py`](src/llmcost/main.py): Implementation or supporting configuration.
- [`src/llmcost/costs.py`](src/llmcost/costs.py): Implementation or supporting configuration.
- [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt): Implementation or supporting configuration.
- [`src/llmcost/__init__.py`](src/llmcost/__init__.py): Implementation or supporting configuration.
- [`tests/test_costs.py`](tests/test_costs.py): Executable checks and regression examples.
- [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml): GitHub Actions job definitions.
- [`README.md`](README.md): Project explanations or operating notes.

[PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md](PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md) contains the component diagram and the implementation walkthrough.

## 3. Can you walk through `summarize` and explain the decision it makes?

The main walkthrough here is `summarize(lines, budget=None)` in [`src/llmcost/costs.py`](src/llmcost/costs.py#L5).

```python
def summarize(lines, budget=None):
    if not isinstance(lines, list) or not lines:
        raise InputError("lines must be a non-empty list")
    by_service = {}
    total = 0.0
    for line in lines:
        try:
            amount = float(line["cost"])
        except (KeyError, TypeError, ValueError) as exc:
            raise InputError("each line needs a numeric cost") from exc
        svc = str(line.get("service", "unknown"))
        by_service[svc] = by_service.get(svc, 0.0) + amount
        total += amount
    over = budget is not None and total > budget
    return {
        "total": round(total, 4),
        "by_service": {k: round(v, 4) for k, v in by_service.items()},
        "over_budget": over,
        "applied": False,
    }
```

The implementation calls `InputError`, `by_service.get`, `by_service.items`, `float`, `isinstance`, `line.get`, `round`, `str`. In an interview, trace those calls in execution order using a fixture input.

## 4. What input validation and failure behavior are implemented?

Explicit failure paths include:

- `InputError('lines must be a non-empty list')` in [`src/llmcost/costs.py`](src/llmcost/costs.py#L7).
- `InputError('each line needs a numeric cost')` in [`src/llmcost/costs.py`](src/llmcost/costs.py#L14).
- `HTTPException(status_code=422, detail=str(exc))` in [`src/llmcost/main.py`](src/llmcost/main.py#L17).

I would test both the condition that reaches each exception and the caller that translates it. An explicit raise does not mean every malformed input or dependency failure is handled.

## 5. Which test would you use to demonstrate correctness?

[`tests/test_costs.py`](tests/test_costs.py#L7) contains `test_totals_and_budget`:

```python
def test_totals_and_budget():
    payload = client.post("/costs", json={"lines": [{'service': 'small', 'cost': 4}, {'service': 'large', 'cost': 9}], "budget": 12.0}).json()
    assert payload["total"] == 13.0
    assert payload["over_budget"] is True
    assert payload["applied"] is False
```

This is a concrete regression example from the repository. Its assertions establish that case; they do not establish behavior for every input or under production load.

## 6. What HTTP interface does the code expose?

- `GET /healthz` → `healthz` in [`src/llmcost/main.py`](src/llmcost/main.py#L8).
- `POST /costs` → `post_costs` in [`src/llmcost/main.py`](src/llmcost/main.py#L13).

These are literal decorators. Application/router prefixes, authentication, and middleware must be checked in the corresponding setup code.

## 7. How would you investigate data ownership and persistence?

Trace the data/configuration files and the code that reads or writes them in the component table. Identify which files are examples, which records are mutable, and which external store is actually configured. I would document those facts before discussing retention, backup, or tenant isolation.

## 8. How would another engineer reproduce your walkthrough?

Start from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

These commands follow repository manifests; environment setup and command results still need to be checked on the target machine.

## 9. What does automation verify, and what does it not prove?

Inspect [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for triggers, permissions, and job commands. I would name the checks that those definitions run and show the latest run separately. A workflow definition alone does not establish a successful deployment, security review, or production SLO.

## 10. How would you present this project in a Forward Deployed Engineer interview?

Start with the user and operational problem described in [`README.md`](README.md). Explain one constraint that changes the implementation, show the linked code or example, and walk through a success case and a failure case. Agree on a measurable acceptance criterion before expanding the solution, and leave a handoff with data boundaries and rollback ownership. Any proposed production or business metric should be identified as a target until measured.

## 11. What is the input-to-output contract of `summarize`?

In [`src/llmcost/costs.py`](src/llmcost/costs.py#L5), `summarize(lines, budget=None)` receives the inputs. The function computes these intermediate values:

- `by_service = {}`
- `total = 0.0`
- `over = budget is not None and total > budget`

Its result is defined by:

- `{'total': round(total, 4), 'by_service': {k: round(v, 4) for k, v in by_service.items()}, 'over_budget': over, 'applied': False}`

## 12. Which decision rules or boundary conditions should an interviewer challenge?

The implementation in [`src/llmcost/costs.py`](src/llmcost/costs.py#L5) branches on:

- `not isinstance(lines, list) or not lines`

A useful extension is a table-driven test that covers each condition just below, at, and above its boundary where applicable. These expressions are the current rules; changing them changes behavior and should be justified by the project’s acceptance criteria.
